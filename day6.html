The main purpose of these pages is to support users and help them find answers to their questions. They can also provide information on the productâ€™s functionalities, as well as its core features and limitations.

These pages are great resources for both businesses and users, as they allow the latter to independently find answers and solutions and businesses to reduce costs by not investing in direct customer support.

Well-designed help center pages are user-friendly, organized, and regularly updated to ensure that users have access to accurate and relevant information.</p>
